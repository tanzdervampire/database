This repository creates the database. It consists of multiple scripts:

* crawler.js crawls tanz-der-vampire.de and spits out crawled.json with all grabbed information.
* crawler2sqlite.js takes crawled.json and converts it into the sqlite database stored as crawled.sqlite.
* generate.js adds further entries to the existing crawled.sqlite database and spits out out as db.sqlite.

Running crawler.js should not ever be necessary again since the data can be taken from crawled.json instead.
crawler2sqlite.js must be run if the database design changes since it sets up the database.
generate.js should be run whenever new information has been added.
